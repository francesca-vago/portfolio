        <p>
          I am a full-stack web developer with a background in marketing and a passion for design. 
          I fell in love with coding in 2019 and decided it was time to try and change my career. 
          I attended a 9-weeks bootcamp in London. 
          I enjoy working on projects from start to finish and I am looking for the right opportunity to improve my skills and learn more.
